## **Assignment 1: Student Management System**

1. Implemented a `Student` class with attributes such as student ID, name, and marks, initialized using a constructor.
2. Created a `calculate_total()` method to compute the total marks using the built-in `sum()` function.
3. Developed a `calculate_percentage()` method to calculate the percentage based on total marks and number of subjects.
4. Designed an `assign_grade()` method to determine the grade using conditional statements based on the percentage obtained.
5. Added a `display_details()` method to display complete student information in a formatted manner.
6. Initialized an empty list to store multiple `Student` objects.
7. Accepted the number of students as input from the user.
8. Used a loop to collect student details and subject-wise marks.
9. Created `Student` objects dynamically and stored them in the list.
10. Iterated through the list to display details of all students.

## **Assignment 2: Employee Salary Calculation Using Inheritance**

1. Created a base class `Employee` containing employee ID, name, and basic salary.
2. Derived a `SalaryEmployee` class from the `Employee` class to demonstrate inheritance.
3. Utilized the `super()` function to initialize parent class attributes.
4. Implemented a `calculate_hra()` method to compute HRA as 20% of the basic salary.
5. Implemented a `calculate_da()` method to compute DA as 10% of the basic salary.
6. Defined a `total_salary()` method to calculate the final salary by summing basic salary, HRA, and DA.
7. Added a `display()` method to present complete employee salary details.
8. Took employee details as input from the user.
9. Created an object of the `SalaryEmployee` class.
10. Calculated and displayed HRA, DA, and total salary.

## **Assignment 3: File Handling for Salary Records**

1. Opened a file named `salary.txt` in append mode to store employee records.
2. Accepted employee ID, name, and basic salary as user input.
3. Calculated the total salary by adding basic salary, HRA (20%), and DA (10%).
4. Wrote employee ID, name, and total salary details into the file.
5. Closed the file after writing to ensure data integrity.
6. Reopened the file in read mode and displayed its content.
